# Dynamsoft Capture Vision for Node

This is a Node.js wrapper for [Dynamsoft Capture Vision](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/server/programming/cplusplus/), enabling you to read barcodes, recognize partial label text, capture documents, and perform other advanced vision tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before running the samples, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- A valid [Dynamsoft Capture Vision SDK license](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense) key

```bash
npm i dynamsoft-capture-vision-for-node@0.0.10 -E
```

## Getting Started

Take barcode reading from an image as an example.

1. Clone the Repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Dynamsoft/capture-vision-nodejs-samples.git
  cd capture-vision-nodejs-samples
  ```

2. Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the desired sample directory (e.g., express or koa) and install the required npm packages:
  ```bash
  cd express
  npm install
  ```

3. Configure the License:

Replace `"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"` in the source code with your actual Dynamsoft license key.

4. Run the Application:

Start the server:
  ```bash
  node index.js
  ```
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the sample application.

The sample code snippet is as follows:

```js
const { LiceseManager, CaptureVisionRouter, EnumPresetTemplate } = require('dynamsoft-capture-vision-for-node');

// You can get your trial license from
// https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense -> Barcode Reader / Capture Vision Suite -> Desktop/Server/Embedded
// The current used license is valid for only one day.
LiceseManager.initLicense('DLS2eyJvcmdhbml6YXRpb25JRCI6IjIwMDAwMSJ9');

(async()=>{
    // you can get the image from https://github.com/Dynamsoft/capture-vision-nodejs-samples/blob/main/AllSupportedBarcodeTypes.png
    // The second parameter `templateName` tells the SDK how to process this image.
    let result = await CaptureVisionRouter.captureAsync('./AllSupportedBarcodeTypes.png', EnumPresetTemplate.PT_READ_BARCODES_READ_RATE_FIRST);
    // refer to https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/server/programming/cplusplus/api-reference/capture-vision-router/auxiliary-classes/captured-result.html?product=dbr&lang=cplusplus
    // or run `console.log(require('node:util').inspect(result, false, null))` to see details
    for(let item of result.barcodeResultItems){
        console.log(item.text);
    }

    // Terminate workers so you can exit the process.
    // Don't call it if you still need to use the SDK.
    await CaptureVisionRouter.terminateIdleWorkers();
})();
```

## Customization

The functionality of DCV largely depends on the choice of template. Dynamsoft offers popular preset templates and continues to expand the library over time. Additionally, the high customizability of DCV is evident in its templates, allowing you to rewrite or replace the template file without requiring changes to the code. Below is an example illustrating how to modify the target barcode formats for a barcode reading task.

### How to Specific the Barcode Formats

1. Copy SDK's `Templates\DBR-PresetTemplates.json` to your place. This file contains all the preset templates related to barcode reading.

2. Search `BarcodeFormatIds` and choose the one you need.

   e.g., If you only want to read specific barcode formats and ensure a high recognition rate, you can modify the `BarcodeFormatIds` object in the `task-read-barcodes-read-rate` task.

3. Suppose you only want to recognize `QRCode` and `DataMatrix`, you can change `BarcodeFormatIds` like this. You can get barcode format strings [here](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/core/enums/barcode-reader/barcode-format.html).

>>   ```diff
>>     "BarcodeFormatSpecificationOptions": [
>>    {
>>      "Name": "bfs1",
>>      "BarcodeFormatIds": [
>>-        "BF_PDF417",
>>        "BF_QR_CODE",
>>        "BF_DATAMATRIX",
>>-        "BF_AZTEC",
>>-        "BF_MICRO_QR",
>>-        "BF_MICRO_PDF417",
>>-        "BF_DOTCODE"
>>      ],
>>      "MirrorMode": "MM_BOTH"
>>    }
>>    ...
>>    ]
>>   ```

4. Apply this template.
   ```js
   CaptureVisionRouter.initSettings('path/to/the/template/file');
   ```

> [!WARNING]
> Due to its powerful customization capabilities, the number of configurable parameters in the templates is extensive and relatively complex. To ease your workload, if the preset templates do not meet your requirements, feel free to [contact us](https://www.dynamsoft.com/contact/) for a customized template.

> [!NOTE]
> Samples for tasks such as Label Recognition and Document Capturing are under development. You can refer to the [C++ document](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/server/programming/cplusplus/user-guide/index.html) or [contact us](https://www.dynamsoft.com/contact/) for assistance.

## About the `capture` like API

`CaptureVisionRouter.captureAsync(...)` process images in [worker_threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html). The maximum number of workers is defined by `CaptureVisionRouter.maxWorkerCount`, which defaults to - 1 (minimum of 1). If you continue to call `captureAsync(...)` while all workers are busy, the tasks will be queued and wait for execution. Here are a few important points about the `capture` like API:

- The synchronous version is `CaptureVisionRouter.capture(...)`, which processes images on the main thread.

- The `capture` like APIs can accept file path `string` or file bytes `Uint8Array` as input data. Currently supported file types are jpg, png, bmp, gif, pdf.

- The `capture` like APIs also accept `DCVImageData` as input data. Typically used to process raw data from a camera.
```ts
interface DCVImageData{
  bytes: Uint8Array;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  stride: number;
  format: EnumImagePixelFormat;
  /** EXIF orientation; 1 or undefined means no rotate. */
  orientation?: number;
}
```

If input data is file bytes or `DCVImageData`, by default, `CaptureVisionRouter.captureAsync(...)` will [transfer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/postMessage#transfer) bytes into `worker`. Thus you can't access to these bytes in main thread after `captureAsync`. This allows for optimal performance.

The following code can prevent bytes from being transferred.
```js
let result = await CaptureVisionRouter.captureAsync(input_data_contains_bytes, {
    templateName: EnumPresetTemplate.XXXX,
    dataTransferType: 'copy'
});
```

## Supported OS/Arch

|  os  |  arch  |
|:-----|:-------|
| win32 (windows) | x86, x64 |
| linux | x64, amd64 |
| darwin (mac) | x64, amd64 |

> [!CAUTION]
> Since the Dynamsoft Capture Vision 2.6 version of `.dylib` is not compiled, the 2.4 version is used on the `darwin` platform, and the template and some other resources may be incompatible with `linux`/`win32`.

<!--If you are sure you don't need to support some of these OS/arch, you can delete some files in `node_modules/dynamsoft-capture-vision-for-node/dylib` and `node_modules/koffi`, to reduce the size. In some cloud platforms like AWS lambda, size is important.-->

You can install resources pkgs (dynamic libraries) for other OS/arch. So you can develop and deploy in different machines. You can check the `<OS>-<arch>@<version>` in this SDK's [`package.json`->`optionalDependencies`](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/capture-vision-nodejs-samples/blob/main/package.json#L56).

```bash
npm i dynamsoft-capture-vision-for-node-lib-<OS>-<arch>@<version> -f -E
```

## Special Notes

### Web Service

[Express sample](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/capture-vision-nodejs-samples/tree/main/express) and [koa sample](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/capture-vision-nodejs-samples/tree/main/koa) shows how to use the SDK in a web service. You do not need to start multiple instance processes in [PM2 Cluster mode](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/#cluster-mode). As mentioned above, Dynamsoft Capture Vision for Node already manages a thread pool.

However, `pm2 start app.js` is still useful, it can automatically restart `app.js` when service crashes.

### AWS Lambda

We also made special adaptation for AWS lambda, see [this sample](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/capture-vision-nodejs-samples/tree/main/lambda). Other similar single-function platforms may have some compatibility issues. If you have any needs, please contact us.

### Character Model for Label Recognizer

When performing text recognition tasksï¼Œyou need to install `dynamsoft-capture-vision-for-node-charactermodel`. You can check the `<version>` in SDK's [`package.json`->`peerDependencies`](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/capture-vision-nodejs-samples/blob/main/package.json#L53).
```bash
npm i dynamsoft-capture-vision-for-node-charactermodel@<version> -E
```

### Multiple `CaptureVisionRouter` Instances

In some **rare** cases you may need multiple `CaptureVisionRouter` instances, such as customizing different templates for each instance. Here is how to use:

```js
let cvr = new CaptureVisionRouter();

let settings = cvr.outputSettings('<templateName>');
settings.foo = bar;
cvr.initSettings(settings);

let result = await cvr.captureAsync('<image>', '<templateName>');
```
